-=Survey writing notes=-

A survey is a collection of sections. Each section is defined thus:

s. Section title

COMMENTS

C and C++ style comments are permitted. Examples:

 not commented /*
 
 multline C style comment
 
 */ not commented
 
 not commented // single line C++ comment


QUESTIONS

A section can have one or more questions:

 q. first question 
 Can be on multiple lines.
 
 Blank lines are ok too.
 .

Each question ends if another "q." or a line starting with a "." is seen.

To identify answers to a question use "a.":

 q. second question
 a.
 [1] Yes
 [2] No
 .

The "a." can be used in front of each answer or only once. 
Unlike questions, answers are assumed to be one per line.
Answers can have context questions. Identify these with cq.:

 q. third question
 a.[1] Yes
 cq. What do you mean?
 a.[____]
 .
 a.[2] No
 .

In this case the "." at the end of the context question is
needed to show that the next answer belongs to the top level 
question.

Use indents to make context questions easier to spot:

 q. third question
 a.
 [1] Yes
         cq. 
         What do you mean?
         a.
         [____]
         .
 [2] No
 .

White space is removed automatically by the parser.

Context questions can be nested:

 q. Did you see anything?
 a.
 [1] Yes
         cq. Do you recall how many?
         a.
         [1] No
         [99] Yes
         	cq. how many exactly?
         	a.__ __
         	.
         .
 [2] No
 .

While questions are automatically numbered they can be given 
explicit ids. These can be useful if some questions need to 
be skipped over:

 q. Do you meet the criteria for these questions?
 a.[1] Yes
 a.[2] No [goto END]
 .
 
 . . .
 
 q.END That is all the questions I have
 .

See GOTO for more on skipping to specific questions.

ANSWERS

* Answer types currently recognized (T = can be numbers or letters, N = must be numbers):
  Use # instead of numbers and the radio or checkbox will be automatically numbered based
  on where it is in the sequence of answers.

[T]         	radio
(T)        	radio
{T}         	checkbox
|T|T|...        select:  each T between the |s is an option
N~N        	select that is just a range of numbers: first # can be bigger than second
___         	text entry: variable size, not checked
__ __         	number entry (basically same as text entry): variable size, checked 
[___]         	text area (multiline): not checked
y/m/d        	date can be any combo of y,m,d or Y,M,D separated by - or /: checked
timestamp       text field with today's date and time
datepicker	calendar style date picker


MACROS

* Macros - define a repeated section of text once and reuse it. 
  Text is blindly inserted before the questionnaire is processed.

  To start a macro use the form:

 =varname
  varname must be letters, numbers or underscores.
  = sign may be indented.
  Text after this will be included in a macro with that name
  until a line = sign is encountered:
 =

Example:

 q. Do you smoke?
 ynexplain
 
 =ynexplain
 [1] yes
         cq. please explain
         a.[____]
         .
 [2] no
 =

Macros can be placed anywhere in the section. Macros 
can contain other macros.

Macros are literally pasted into the text of the survey. 
Note that in the following example the lack of "." at the
end of the "yesnoexplain" macro defined above allows 
us to add context questions for the "[2] no" answer later. 
Example:

 q. Are you currently working?
 ynexplain
     cq. If not are you currently looking for work?
     ynexplain
     .

Fully expanded:

 q. Are you currently working?
 a.
 [1] yes
         cq. please explain
         a.[____]
         .
 [2] no
     cq. If not are you currently looking for work?
     [1] yes
             cq. please explain
             a.[____]
             .
     [2] no
     .

MACRO PARAMETERS

Macros can have parameters. A parameter is any sequence of
non-space characters separated by spaces. Macro names can
be used as paramter values and these will be evaluated.
Use quotes to encapsulate macros with parameters. 
Examples:
 =MACRO arg1 $arg2 "arg3"
 "arg3", arg1, $arg2,
 =

 MACRO first second "last 'one'"

This invocation of MACRO will look like this fully expanded:
 last 'one', first, second

Invoked with no arguments an empty string would be expanded
for each argument:
 MACRO

Becomes
 ,,

Macros can be used as arguments:
 =MACRO arg1 $arg2 "arg3"
 "arg3"
 arg1
 $arg2
 =

 =MACRO2 $name
 hi there $name
 =
 MACRO "MACRO2 Steve" second third

Would become
 third
 hi there Steve
 second

If the original arrangement of arguments in MACRO were used
MACRO2 would not be invoked as it would not be by itself on
a single line.
 
GOTO 

Sometimes you want to skip questions when conducting an
interview. To indicate this in a questionnaire use [goto LABEL].
Example:

 q. Have you ever been homeless?
 a.
 [1] yes
 [2] no [goto NEVERHOMELESS]
 .

 q. When was the last time you were homeless? 
 a. y/m/d
 .

 q.NEVERHOMELESS Some other question
 .

Adding the [goto ...] construct in a questionnaire will add a
link to the question. This only makes sense for top level 
questions. The link will not work if the label applies to a
context question.
