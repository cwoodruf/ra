Object oriented wrapper for database operations.

It is intended to be easy to port and extend.

Usage:
	[in the frame directory]
	db/buildmodels.php mydb 

	[will build class *-base.php files for tables in mydb in models/base]
	
	vim models/mydb/MydbDB.php 
	[add login details]

	[make your own extensions of the *-base.php classes to change them]

You can also rebuild individual tables:

	db/buildmodels.php mydb mytable

You can also change the output directory:

	db/buildmodels.php mydb mytable othermodels/base

for all tables:

	db/buildmodels.php mydb "" othermodels/base

Each class file contains schema information in a public $schema variable
that can be used as an aid for automatically making forms etc based on 
the table information. 

Each class inherits methods from either the Entity or Relation base class
defined in abstract-common.php. An Entity is a stand alone table that has
only a single field as a key (if any). A Relation has a multi field key.

If you make fields with the pattern {tablename}_id and use them consistently
the code generator will add the table information to the $primarykey.

Currently only mysql is supported. However, it should be relatively easy to port to
another rdbms. 

This will define the Entity and Relation classes that you can then map to tables.
For this to work you need to create two php arrays $tables with schema information
and a $db array with login information for the database. An example is included in
the svn tree.

Relation differs from Entity in that a relation has a multiple field key.

The operations: ins, upd, del, getone, getall are currently defined.

Feel free to run your own queries with the "run" method. This method works similar
to sprintf in that you have a query string and then a variable length list of fields
that can be inserted into the query string using standard printf syntax.
